    # Upcoming versions of Openshift-Pipelines will have this option.
    # Follow the PR - https://github.com/tektoncd/operator/pull/1025
    # Since tekton-config resources are additive, adding `keep-since` here, would conflict with the `keep`
    # which comes with default configurations when Openshift-Pipelines is deployed.
    # To Do: Use `keep-since` option
    # Retain resources younger than 2 days (2880 mins)
    # keep-since: 2880
    # Run the TaskRun pruner every day at 0800 Hrs (8:00 AM) system time.
