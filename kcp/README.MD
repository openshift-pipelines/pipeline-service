# Pipeline Services on managed KCP

## Clusters access

Create a directory with the following files:

* `argocd.yaml`: kubeconfig with the active context connecting to the argocd instance;
* `kcp.yaml`: kubeconfig with the active context connecting to your KCP workspace;
* `plnsvc.yaml`: the kubeconfig with with the active context connecting to the Pipeline
  Service cluster.

This directory will be referenced as `KUBECONFIG_DIR`.

The first time one of the deploy/test/reset script is run, use `-k $KUBECONFIG_DIR`.
This will create a local copy of those files in `kcp/work/kubeconfig`. Those files will
then be used by default for every command, until you overwrite their value by specifying
a new `-k $KUBECONFIG_DIR` parameter.

## Clusters configuration

The `deploy.sh -e staging` script will configure the various systems in the staging
environment.

The `test.sh -e staging` script will run a quick pipeline/trigger test on the staging
environment. The expected output looks like this:

```bash

### Script summary

1. Connect the plnsvc cluster and KCP to ArgoCD.
2. Deploy the various gitops applications to the appropriate clusters.

### Pre-requisites

1. You need to be able to log into the clusters (see the `Cluster access` section).
2. You need to install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
3. You need to install [argocd](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli_installation/).
4. You need to install [yq](http://mikefarah.github.io/yq/#install)
