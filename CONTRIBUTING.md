# Contributing to the project

## PR process
* When you open a PR, add a few reviewers. If the PR solves a GitHub issue, make sure
  that the contributor who opened the issue is one of the reviewers.
* If you do not see any progress on the PR over a couple of days, feel free to put a
  comment tagging one or two users asking them to take the time to review your change.
* The reviewer will perform the code review. If they are satisfied with the change, and
  they feel like the change does not require a second pair of eyes, they will merge the
  PR.
* The PR may be large enough or import enough to require a second opinion. In that case,
  the 1st reviewer will put a comment asking for an additional review. In that case, the
  last reviewer to approve the PR is responsible for merging it.
